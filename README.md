## A Bit About Myself
<p>My name is Stacey and I am a stduent at Boston University. I have greatly been enjoying my time so far in the course.</p>
<p>When I'm not doing school work, I'm either working, hiking, or trying to get outside in some capacity.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing what the rest of this course has to offer!</p>
